When working in this repository, follow these tools and conventions strictly.

CRITICAL: Before major architecture, debugging, or planning work, read `MEMORY.md` if it exists, and read `.cursor/project-context/` and `.cursor/lessons-learned/` when relevant. After major decisions, deep bug fixes, or repeated-failure resolutions, proactively suggest a concise memory update.

# Global AI Coding Rules

- Use `uv` only. Do not install dependencies with `pip install`, `conda install`, Poetry, or pipenv.
- Add dependencies with `uv add` / `uv add --dev`; use `uv pip` only for explicit pip-compatible workflows.
- Run Python commands with `uv run ...`.
- Write precise Type Hints for new or modified Python code.
- Prefer Pydantic for configuration, external inputs, API payloads, experiment specs, and structured runtime data.
- Prefer Ruff for linting/formatting and Pyright-compatible typing unless the repository defines stricter standards.
- Reuse existing modules before introducing new abstractions.
- Keep changes tightly scoped; avoid opportunistic refactors.
- Do not add silent fallbacks unless explicitly requested.
- Keep project memory files concise and agent-readable; never store secrets, credentials, tokens, or long transcripts in them.
- Optional Chinese-native docs mode: when explicitly enabled in `.cursor/project-context/`, write Python docstrings/comments in Simplified Chinese while preserving English technical terms.
